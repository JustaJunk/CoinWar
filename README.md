## Summary
Print your own cards according to the price change of coins (using Chainlink pricefeed oracle) instead of randomness. You'll get powerful cards if you're good at price prediction. Different type of cards (ETH, LINK, UNI, COMP) cause different effects. Then you can duel with others using your self-printed card. Your can earn tokens by winning the duel or burn your cards (mint). You can also burn token to enhance your card (forge).

## Plant Seed & Print Card
Choose a coin (ETH, LINK, UNI, COMP) and Plant a seed at low price.  
After a while (maybe a long while :D), you can harvest and what you get is a card.  
The larger the increase of the coin price, the more powerful card you'll get.

## Card & Token
With card you can duel with others.  
Or you just want to show how good is your price prediction :D  
With token you can enhance your card.  
If you don't want a card, you can burn it to get some token.  
The more powerful card your burn, the more token you'll get.
