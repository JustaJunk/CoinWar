Inspired by yu-gi-oh (a classic anime)

## Plant Seed & Print Card
Choose a coin (ETH, LINK, UNI, COMP) and Plant a seed at low price.  
After a while (maybe a long while :D), you can harvest and what you get is a card.  
The larger the increase of the coin price, the more powerful card you'll get.  

## Card & Token
With card you can dual with others.  
Or you just want to show how good is your price prediction :D  
With token you can enhance your card.  
If you don't want a card, you can burn it to get some token.  
The more powerful card your burn, the more token you'll get.  

## Dual
Arrange yor card (at most 5) and dual with others.  
This is your card slot look like: | ETH0 | LINK | UNI | COMP | ETH1 |  
Different type of card has different effect.  
### ETH0
Basic power  
### LINK
Add ETH1 power to basic power with a ratio associated with your LINK power.  
### UNI
Swap ETH0 if your UNI power larger than opponent's ETH0 power.  
### COMP
Borrow some ETH1 power from opponent.  

## TODO

1. Check smart contract security  
2. front-end  
3. artwork  
4. Use polygon or Solana to avoid extremely high gas fee
